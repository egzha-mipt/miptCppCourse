Berserk
In this world, is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law?
        Is it like the hand of God hovering above?
At least it is true               that man has no control; 
                                            even over his own will.

The divine is in you, not in concepts and books. Truth must be experienced, not taught. 
With every upheaval of my life I eventually gained something, it cannot be denied, I became freer, more spiritual, deeper, but I also became more lonely, more incomprehensible, more cold.
When we hate someone, we hate in their image what sits in ourselves. What is not in ourselves does not touch us. 
For me, however, the only thing that matters is to learn to love the world, not to despise it, not to hate it and myself, but to look at it, at myself and at all beings with love, with delight and respect. 
You seek too much; because of over-seeking you do not have time to find. 
Basically, freedom is only exercised by man in the choice of addiction.
- Hermann Hesse

I also began to realize that pain and disappointment and longing are sent to us not to break our spirit, to rob us of our worth and dignity, but to transform us.
- Hermann Hesse's “Peter Kamenzind.”

Everything that lives is designed to end. 
		We are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death.
	 Is	 this 	a 	curse? 
		Or	 some 	kind 	of 	punishment?



			I often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle... 		and wonder if we'll ever get the chance to kill him.
